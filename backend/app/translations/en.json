My current work involves designing and developing Fullstack systems using technologies like Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, and RESTful APIs. I’ve built a strong technical foundation in computer networks, web protocols, Linux, version control (Git & GitHub), and software architecture. All my progress is backed by hands‑on projects available on my GitHub. I also leverage AI tools to accelerate learning, improve code quality, and experiment with creative problem‑solving techniques. Currently focused on deepening my backend expertise and contributing to meaningful projects; I’m open to opportunities where I can grow, collaborate, and turn knowledge into impact.",
